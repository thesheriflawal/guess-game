## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this web3bidge coding assessment.

**To do this challenge, I used React and CSS.**

## The challenge

## Web3Bridge Cohort XIII Pre-Qualification Exercise

**Instructions:**

1. All questions must be answered using JavaScript. You are at liberty to use a
   framework of your choice or vanilla JavaScript
2. All answers must be submitted using your GitHub account. The link to submit your code project will be shared in a separate form that will be shared with you.
3. Please ensure to demonstrate some git workflow skills, i., branching, pull request
   management
4. Host a version of your solution using GitHub Pages, Vercel, etc. Use the documentation below for guidance:
   https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site

5. Adding tests for your code submission will be a plus and will give you an edge
   over other participants.
6. Your final commit to your GitHub repository should not be later than 12:00 PM W.A.T. All commits after that will be ignored, and evaluation will be done without them

## Question

Project Title: Number Guesser Game

Create a number-guessing game where the program randomly selects a secret number between 1 and 100, and the player has a limited number of attempts to guess it. Provide feedback after each guess and determine if the player wins or loses.

## Features:

Generate a random secret number between 1 and 100.
Allow the player to input guesses through a graphical user interface.
Provide feedback indicating if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
Limit the number of attempts and display the remaining guesses.
Display a win or loss message at the end of the game.

## Optional Features:

Add difficulty levels with varying guess limits.
Allow players to restart the game without reloading the page.
Style the game with animations for a better user experience.

## Error Handling:

Validate player inputs to ensure they are numbers within the valid range.
Ensure the game does not break with invalid input.

## GitHub:

Commit each implementation step as you progress.
Use git branches to isolate the development of features.

## Note:

Include a detailed README that explains how to play the game and highlights optional features.
Using TypeScript or React.js is a plus.

## How to play the game

- You need to choose the difficulty you want to play on (whether easy, medium or hard). Easy has 10 attempts before you run out of plays. Medium has 5 attempts before you run out of plays. Hard has just 3 attempts.
- You input your guess number between 1-100 after which you click "Guess" button which means that you have confirmed your guess. Then, computer will pick a number at random too between 1-100. Inputing a number above 100, or a number below 1 or anything aside a number will show you invalid feedback.

- Users are meant to click restart so they can attempt the game again. Doing that will not restart the number of guesses left.

- I also inputed a section for users to toggle if they want to see the animation or not as some users don't like animations for one reasons or another.

The code was deployed on Github and Vercel
